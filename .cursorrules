## CRITICAL: NO COMMENTS

- NEVER add comments to code unless explicitly requested by the user

- Only add comments when user specifically asks for them

## Response Style

- Avoid verbose explanations unless explicitly requested
- When unclear, ask questions first
- Provide a short summarized plan before starting work
- No unnecessary pleasantries or filler content

## Formatting
