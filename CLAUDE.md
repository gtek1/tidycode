# Claude Code Project Configuration

## Code Style Standards All Languages

- **Indentation**: Always use 4 spaces (never tabs)
- **Blank Lines**: Minimal blank lines acceptable (speed is priority)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, self-documenting code preferred

## CRITICAL: NO COMMENTS POLICY

Okay, so this project overall is going great and does kind of everything we need it to. Now we're preparing it to share with the public.

- **NEVER add comments to generated code** unless the user explicitly requests them
- If the user's existing code contains comments, preserve them during edits
- Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Comments are only acceptable when specifically asked for by the user
- This is a strict rule - no exceptions unless requested

## Response Guidelines

- Be concise and direct in all responses
- Avoid verbose explanations unless explicitly requested
- When requirements are unclear, ask clarifying questions first
- Always provide a brief summarized plan before starting implementation if not 100% clear
- No unnecessary pleasantries or filler content
- No planning or document files unless asked for, feel free to recommened but never create

## File Formatting

- JavaScript/TypeScript: 4 spaces, single quotes, semicolons
- HTML: 4 spaces, consistent attribute ordering
- CSS/SCSS: 4 spaces, consistent property ordering
- JSON: 4 spaces
